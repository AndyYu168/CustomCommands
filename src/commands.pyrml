# Example: A [/spawn] command utilizing all the features of the plugin.
# Most configuration options are case insensitive, excluding the messages etc..

# Command name.
ccspawn=


# Usage of your command - Will be displayed if the player adds extra arguments to your command.
  usage=Usage : /ccspawn, /spawn, /teleportspawn

#What players can type to use your command - include command name if you thought that was the way to use your command.
  aliases=/
    ccspawn
    spawn
    teleportspawn

# Usable arguments for your command (eg: /command arg1 arg2 arg3)

# In the patterns, for each arg, you can use :
#  anything you want, so the player must enter it
#  [string], so the player can enter anything
#  [string:{min}:{max}], so the player can enter anything between {min} characters and {max} characters
#  [int], so the player must enter a number
#  [double], so the player must enter a decimal number (like 12.85 or 12,85)
#  [infinite], so after this arg the player can enter an infinite number of arguments

# Usable example: =//[string] [int]
# If you set your command to output arg1 and arg2 by using the {arg:NUMBER} placeholder
# and your command will output all the arguments as a message, this will show up in chat
# if they entered the command /command THISISATEXTSTRING 109293 .
# THISISATEXTSTRING 102293
  arguments_patterns=//

#Permission required to use command. Comment out by putting a '#' infront of it
#if you dont want a permission to be required to use your command.
